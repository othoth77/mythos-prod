# Mythos OS — AI Handover

**Last updated:** 2026-08-04 UTC
**From:** Stage 4S — Purchases CRUD, supplier synchronization, and page workflow extraction
**To:** Next AI session

## Repository State (verified 2026-08-04)

```
Branch:   main
HEAD:     f213822 (implementation commit; documentation follow-up pending)
```

**Stage 4S is implemented and validated.** Purchases CRUD, numbering, rendering, TVA totals, bulk selection, and supplier option synchronization were extracted from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/accounting-purchases.js`. Stage 4S passes 56/56; directly relevant targeted suites pass 514/514 total. Full suite was run once: all Stage 4 suites (4A–4S) pass 1088/1088; the same 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.

Implementation commit: `f213822` — `refactor: extract purchases workflow`
Verified baseline before Stage 4S: `f7e562211608235ecf335ae515dfb967f72df222`

> Note: `docs/AI_HANDOVER.md` was stale — last edited for Stage 3C (893 tests). Stages 3D–3H were committed between then and Stage 4A without updating this file. The correct baseline entering Stage 4A was 1405 tests (not 893).

## Stage 4S — Purchases CRUD, Supplier Synchronization, and Page Workflow Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent Purchases CRUD, numbering, rendering, TVA totals, bulk selection, and supplier option synchronization from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/accounting-purchases.js` without changing behavior.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/accounting-purchases.js` | NEW: Purchase numbering, rendering, bulk selection, CRUD form, supplier options, and supplier synchronization |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted Purchases implementation; supplier management, TVA calculator, statistics, and broader financial reports remain |
| `index.html` | Loads `accounting-purchases.js` after `accounting-expenses.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4s-test.js` | NEW: 56 tests for globals, numbering, rendering, TVA totals, selection, CRUD, supplier synchronization, exclusions, and script order |
| `tests/stage4r-test.js` | Updated the Stage 4R extraction boundary and dependency-order assertion |

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.purchases/savePurchases/suppliers`, formatting/date utilities, generic modal helpers, the existing `calculateFromTTC`, `renderComptaViews`, DOM, alerts, confirmation, and `setTimeout`. Existing inline handlers, supplier-detail calls, router calls, Dashboard/statistics reads, and accounting overview calls retain identical globals and timing. Every write continues through `STORE.savePurchases` and the approved `_storeSave` pipeline. Supplier management, TVA calculation, statistics, and broader financial reports remain in `js/app.js`.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/accounting-purchases.js`, `js/shared/accounting-expenses.js` | ✓ |
| `tests/stage4s-test.js` | ✓ 56/56 |

| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4S) | ✓ 1088/1088 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Twenty-four suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the same documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions. No Stage 4 suite failed and no new regression was found.

### Risks and Operations

- The 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.
- Supplier management, TVA calculation, statistics, reconciliation, and broader financial reports remain deliberately deferred.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4R — Expenses CRUD, Categories, Reports, and Page Workflow Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent Expenses CRUD, period filtering, payment/category reports, category management, and category/subcategory form workflow from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/accounting-expenses.js` without changing behavior.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/accounting-expenses.js` | NEW: Expense filter state, page rendering, payment/category reports, category CRUD, subcategory options, and expense CRUD form |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted Expenses implementation; purchases, statistics, and broader financial reports remain |
| `index.html` | Loads `accounting-expenses.js` after `accounting-cash.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4r-test.js` | NEW: 69 tests for globals, categories, subcategories, filters, reports, totals, CRUD, writes, exclusions, and script order |
| `tests/stage4p-test.js`, `tests/stage4q-test.js` | Updated accounting extraction boundaries and dependency-order assertions |

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.expenses/saveExpenses/expenseCategories/saveExpenseCategories`, formatting/date/week utilities, generic modal helpers, `renderComptaViews`, DOM, alerts, and confirmation. Existing inline handlers, router calls, Dashboard/statistics reads, and accounting overview calls retain identical globals and timing. Every write continues through the approved `STORE`/`_storeSave` pipeline. Purchases and broader financial/statistical reports remain in `js/app.js`.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/accounting-expenses.js`, `js/shared/accounting-cash.js`, `js/shared/accounting-bank.js` | ✓ |

| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4R) | ✓ 1033/1033 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Twenty-three suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the same documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions. No Stage 4 suite failed and no new regression was found.

### Risks and Operations

- The 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.
- Purchases, statistics, and broader financial/accounting reports remain deliberately deferred.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4Q — Cash Entries CRUD and Page Workflow Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent Cash entries CRUD, filtering, rendering, linked-record workflow, and Bank withdrawal selection from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/accounting-cash.js` without changing behavior.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/accounting-cash.js` | NEW: Cash filter state, page rendering, record linking, bulk selection, CRUD form, and Bank withdrawal selection |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted Cash implementation; expenses, statistics, and shared accounting helpers remain |
| `index.html` | Loads `accounting-cash.js` after `accounting-bank.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4q-test.js` | NEW: 58 tests for globals, rendering, filters, links, writes, CRUD, selection, Bank choices, exclusions, and script order |
| `tests/stage4p-test.js` | Updated the Stage 4P integration boundary and script-order assertion for the Stage 4Q consumer |

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.cashEntries/saveCashEntries`, Bank/expense/invoice readers, formatting and date utilities, invoice totals, generic modal helpers, `renderComptaViews`, DOM, alerts, and confirmation. Existing inline handlers, router calls, Dashboard reads, and Bank-link contracts retain identical globals and timing. Every write continues through `STORE.saveCashEntries` and the approved `_storeSave` pipeline. Expenses and statistics remain in `js/app.js`.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/accounting-cash.js`, `js/shared/accounting-bank.js` | ✓ |
| `tests/stage4q-test.js` | ✓ 58/58 |

| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4Q) | ✓ 965/965 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Twenty-two suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the same documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions. No Stage 4 suite failed and no new regression was found.

### Risks and Operations

- The 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.
- Expenses, statistics, and broader accounting helpers remain deliberately deferred.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4P — Bank Entries CRUD and Page Workflow Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent Bank entries CRUD, cleanup, filtering, rendering, linked-record workflow, and import results from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/accounting-bank.js` without changing behavior.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/accounting-bank.js` | NEW: Bank filter state, cleanup, CRUD, list selection, page rendering, linked-record dialogs, and CSV import/results workflow |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted Bank implementation; Cash, expenses, shared accounting helpers, and statistics remain |
| `index.html` | Loads `accounting-bank.js` after `devis.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4p-test.js` | NEW: 59 tests for globals, cleanup, icons, rendering, filters, selection, CRUD, modals, compatibility, exclusions, and script order |

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.bankEntries/saveBankEntries`, expense/invoice/contract/supplier readers, formatting utilities, invoice/contract total helpers, generic modal helpers, `renderComptaViews`, DOM, `FileReader`, alerts, and confirmation. Existing inline handlers, router calls, supplier views, dashboard reads, and initialization retain identical global names and timing. Every write continues through `STORE.saveBankEntries` and the approved `_storeSave` pipeline. Cash and expense workflows remain in `js/app.js`.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/accounting-bank.js` | ✓ |
| `tests/stage4p-test.js` | ✓ 59/59 |
| `tests/stage4o-test.js` | ✓ 72/72 |

| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4P) | ✓ 908/908 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Twenty-one suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the same documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions. No Stage 4 suite failed and no new regression was found.

### Risks and Operations

- The 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.
- Cash, expenses, statistics, and broader accounting helpers remain deliberately deferred.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4O — Devis CRUD Workflow Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent Devis CRUD, form workflow, numbering, line totals, issuer/logo/stamp handling, and preview rendering from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/devis.js` without changing behavior.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/devis.js` | NEW: issuer definitions, stamp generation, numbering, CRUD, list/form workflows, logo handling, line calculations, and preview HTML |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted Devis implementation and retained concise module references; unrelated compatibility functions and generic `printModal` remain |
| `index.html` | Loads `devis.js` after `rdvs.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4o-test.js` | NEW: 72 tests for globals, numbering, stamp, list/form, clients, logos, calculations, CRUD, preview, compatibility, and script order |
| `tests/stage4m-test.js` | Updated the deferred Devis-numbering assertion to reflect the Stage 4O extraction |

### Extracted Globals

`KACEM_PRINT_LOGO_SRC`, `DEVIS_SOCIETES`, `getStampSVGFor`, `nextDevisNum`, `splitDevisNum`, `editDevis`, `deleteDevis`, `saveDevis`, `populateDevisList`, `cancelDevisForm`, `updateDevisLogoPreview`, `onDevisSocieteChange`, `onDevisLogoFileChange`, `resetDevisLogo`, `syncDevisNumberPreview`, `initDevisForm`, `fillDevisClientSelect`, `syncDevisClientFromSelect`, `devisLineCount`, `addDevisLine`, `removeDevisLine`, `calcDevisTotals`, `buildDevisHTML`, `printDevis`, `closeDevisPreview`

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `MYTHOS_PRINT_LOGO_SRC`, `STORE.devis/saveDevis/clients`, formatting and number utilities, guarded `LOGGER`, `showView`, DOM, `FileReader`, confirmation, alerts, and `setTimeout`. Existing inline handlers and RDV linked-source reads retain the same storage and global contracts. Writes continue through `STORE.saveDevis` and the approved `_storeSave` pipeline. The existing legacy-number filtering behavior is preserved exactly.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/devis.js` | ✓ |
| `tests/stage4o-test.js` | ✓ 72/72 |
| `tests/stage4n-test.js` | ✓ 66/66 |
| `tests/stage4m-test.js` | ✓ 76/76 |
| `tests/stage4c-test.js` | ✓ 32/32 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4O) | ✓ 849/849 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Twenty-one suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the same documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions. The final Stage 4O suite was rerun after moving its issuer definitions and remained 72/72.

### Risks and Operations

- The 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.
- Generic `printModal` and unrelated early compatibility functions remain in app.js intentionally.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4N — RDV CRUD and Form Workflow Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent RDV two-step form, source dropdowns, fee selection, list rendering, CRUD, and tombstone behavior from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/rdvs.js` while preserving existing behavior and global interfaces.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/rdvs.js` | NEW: RDV form workflow, linked-source helpers, fee handling, CRUD, rendering, and delete tombstone |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted RDV implementation and retained a concise module reference; following legacy compatibility helpers remain unchanged |
| `index.html` | Loads `rdvs.js` after `invoices.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4n-test.js` | NEW: 66 tests for globals, wizard flow, sources, dropdowns, fee modes, CRUD, tombstones, rendering, compatibility, and script order |

### Extracted Globals

`rdvOpenForm`, `rdvClose`, `rdvShowExistingRdvs`, `rdvGoToStep2`, `rdvBackToStep1`, `getAllInvoices`, `getAllDevis`, `getAllContracts`, `rdvLoadDropdowns`, `rdvCalcFee`, `rdvFeeTypeSelectChanged`, `rdvInvoiceChanged`, `rdvDevisChanged`, `rdvContractChanged`, `rdvSave`, `rdvRender`, `rdvEdit`, `rdvDelete`

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.rdvs/saveRdvs`, invoice/devis/contract/client/collaborator/nature/representation readers, `esc`, `todayStr`, `_markDeleted`, DOM, alerts, confirmation, and `setTimeout`. Router, Calendar, Dashboard, and inline handlers continue using identical global names. RDV writes remain on `STORE.saveRdvs` and deletes still record `mp_rdvs` tombstones. No listener, timer, or initialization behavior was duplicated.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/rdvs.js` | ✓ |
| `tests/stage4n-test.js` | ✓ 66/66 |
| `tests/stage4m-test.js` | ✓ 76/76 |
| `tests/stage4d-test.js` | ✓ 32/32 |
| `tests/stage4e-test.js` | ✓ 31/31 |
| `tests/stage4c-test.js` | ✓ 32/32 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4N) | ✓ 777/777 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Twenty suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions. No Stage 4 suite failed and no new regression was found.

### Risks and Operations

- The 12 documented pre-existing suite failures remain unchanged.
- `stableRdvPrestRows` and unrelated legacy compatibility helpers remain in app.js because they are outside this coherent workflow and were not required by its callers.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4M — Invoices CRUD Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the coherent Invoices CRUD, form, line calculation, numbering, list rendering, and preview rendering responsibilities from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/invoices.js` while preserving all existing behavior and globals.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/invoices.js` | NEW: invoice list, numbering, form, lines, totals, CRUD, preview, print HTML, and `stableLineCount` |
| `js/app.js` | Removed extracted invoice implementations and retained concise reference comments; Devis helpers, compatibility stubs, and generic `printModal` remain |
| `index.html` | Loads `invoices.js` after `mission-orders.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4m-test.js` | NEW: 76 tests covering globals, rendering, numbering, forms, clients, lines, totals, CRUD, preview, compatibility, and script order |

### Extracted Globals

`stableLineCount`, `renderList`, `nextInvoiceNum`, `splitInvoiceNum`, `initNewForm`, `handleInvoiceTypeChange`, `handleInvoiceYearChange`, `handleInvoiceDateChange`, `syncInvoiceNumberPreview`, `fillClientSelect`, `fillClientFromSelect`, `addLine`, `removeLine`, `getLines`, `calcTotals`, `saveInvoice`, `editInvoice`, `deleteInvoice`, `cancelForm`, `previewInvoice`, `closePreview`, `buildInvoiceHTML`

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.invoices/saveInvoices/clients/saveClients`; invoice and formatting utilities from `utils.js`; `showView` and `updateSidebarStats` from router; guarded `LOGGER`; DOM, alerts, and confirmation. Existing router callbacks, Dashboard, Clients, Natures, and inline handlers continue using identical global names. The approved `_storeSave` write pipeline remains unchanged. Pre-existing invoice compatibility stubs in app.js were intentionally not modified.

### Validation

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/invoices.js` | ✓ |
| `tests/stage4m-test.js` | ✓ 76/76 |
| `tests/stage4l-test.js` | ✓ 59/59 |
| `tests/stage4g-test.js` | ✓ 49/49 |
| `tests/stage4e-test.js` | ✓ 31/31 |
| `tests/stage4f-test.js` | ✓ 37/37 |
| `tests/stage4c-test.js` | ✓ 32/32 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full Stage 4 suite (4A–4M) | ✓ 711/711 |

The complete repository suite was run once. Nineteen suite files passed. Twelve suite files failed only through the documented pre-existing `_memCache` core failure and cascading Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions; no Stage 4 suite failed and no new regression was found.

### Risks and Operations

- Known pre-existing failures remain unchanged: `tests/core-test.js` (`_memCache`) and dependent Stage 1–3 subprocess regressions.
- Duplicate compatibility stubs remain intentionally deferred pending inline-handler audit.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Data migration: not performed.

## Stage 4L — Mission Orders CRUD Extraction

**Objective:** Extract Ordres de mission CRUD, vehicle helpers, form behavior, preview rendering, owned constants, and state from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/mission-orders.js` (AGENTS.md §19 step 6, continued).

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/mission-orders.js` | NEW: mission-order CRUD, vehicle helpers, form behavior, preview HTML, company definitions, mission texts, and `stableOmPersonCount` |
| `js/app.js` | Removed the extracted mission-order implementation and retained concise reference comments; generic `printModal` remains in app.js |
| `index.html` | Loads `mission-orders.js` after `contracts.js` and before `taches.js` |
| `tests/stage4l-test.js` | NEW: 59 tests for globals, rendering, vehicles, form helpers, CRUD, preview, compatibility, and script integration |

### Extracted Globals

`SOCIETES`, `OM_MISSION_TEXTS`, `stableOmPersonCount`, `renderOMList`, `ensureDefaultVehicules`, `renderOmVehiculeOptions`, `updateOmLogoPreview`, `onOmVehiculeChange`, `addOmVehicule`, `initOMForm`, `setOmDateQuick`, `setOmTimeQuick`, `applyOmMissionType`, `addOmPerson`, `getOMPersons`, `saveOM`, `editOM`, `deleteOM`, `cancelOM`, `previewOM`, `closeOMPreview`, `buildOMHTML`

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Resolved at call time: `STORE.oms/saveOms/vehicules/saveVehicules/collabs/saveCollabs`; utilities `esc`, `cleanPrintText`, `formatDateLong`, `todayStr`, `dateInputValue`, `getStampSVG`; router globals `showView`, `updateSidebarStats`; browser DOM, prompts, alerts, and confirmation. Existing inline handlers, router calls, and Collaborateurs links continue using the same global names. Pre-existing compatibility stubs in app.js were not modified.

### Test Results

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `tests/stage4l-test.js` | ✓ 59/59 |
| `tests/stage4h-test.js` | ✓ 51/51 |
| `tests/stage4k-test.js` | ✓ 88/88 |
| `tests/stage4c-test.js` | ✓ 32/32 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | ✓ 77/77 |
| Syntax: `js/app.js`, `js/shared/mission-orders.js` | ✓ |
| Full suite: all Stage 4 (4A-4L) | ✓ 882 pass, pre-existing unchanged |

### Known Risks

The pre-existing `tests/core-test.js` `_memCache` failure remains unchanged. Duplicate compatibility stubs in `js/app.js` remain intentionally deferred pending a complete inline-handler audit.

## Stage 4K — Contracts CRUD Extraction

**Objective:** Extract Contracts CRUD from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/contracts.js` (AGENTS.md §19 step 6, continued).

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/contracts.js` | NEW: 186 lines — Contracts CRUD verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 8130 → 7941 lines. Contracts block (lines 3682–3871, 190 lines) deleted; reference comment: `// Contracts CRUD moved to js/shared/contracts.js` |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/shared/contracts.js?v=20260801">` after representations.js |
| `tests/stage4k-test.js` | NEW: 88 tests — globals, renderContracts (empty/data), nextContractRef (empty/with-existing), contractTotals, contractStatusLabel, fillContractClientSelect, fillContractClientFromSelect (match/no-match), toggleContractVatAdvance (enabled/disabled), calcContractTotals, initContractForm, saveContract (create/update/guard), editContract (existing/unknown), deleteContract (confirmed/cancelled), cancelContractForm, regression chain |

### Extracted Globals (now in shared/contracts.js, removed from app.js)

`nextContractRef`, `contractTotals`, `contractStatusLabel`, `fillContractClientSelect`, `fillContractClientFromSelect`, `toggleContractVatAdvance`, `calcContractTotals`, `renderContracts`, `initContractForm`, `saveContract`, `editContract`, `deleteContract`, `cancelContractForm`

No state variables to extract (no `let` or `var` contract state declarations in app.js).

### Dependencies

contracts.js resolved at call time: `STORE.contracts/saveContracts/clients/saveClients` (defined in app.js STORE block); `num`, `esc`, `fmtMoney`, `formatDate`, `todayStr` (utils.js); `showView`, `updateSidebarStats` (router.js); browser DOM (`document`, `alert`, `confirm`).

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4K)

`js/app.js` → `js/shared/calendar.js` → `js/shared/dashboard.js` → `js/shared/natures.js` → `js/shared/clients.js` → `js/shared/collaborateurs.js` → `js/shared/fournisseurs.js` → `js/shared/representations.js` → **`js/shared/contracts.js`** → `js/taches.js`

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tests/stage4k-test.js` | 88 | ✓ 88/88 |
| `tests/stage4j-test.js` | 66 | ✓ 66/66 (regression) |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | 77 | ✓ 77/77 (regression) |

Full suite: all Stage 4 (4A-4K) pass. Pre-existing failures: core-test.js (_memCache), stage 1-3 cascading subprocess regressions (documented). No new regressions.

### Commit

`ec42b4a` — `docs(handover): clean Stage 4K handover, record test results`

### Known Issues

Same as prior stages: `tests/core-test.js` pre-existing `_memCache` failure.

---

## Next Stage: Stage 4T

Stage 4S is implemented. Continue the bounded accounting extraction per AGENTS.md §19 step 6.

**Exact next scope:** inventory and extract the coherent financial reports, reconciliation, flow diagram, and analytics dashboard workflow into `js/shared/accounting-reports.js`, preserving report calculations, storage reads, router globals, and DOM contracts. Accounting overview, supplier management, TVA calculation, and unrelated statistics remain deferred until subsequent bounded stages.

---

## Stage 4G — Clients CRUD Extraction

**Objective:** Extract Clients CRUD from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/clients.js` (AGENTS.md §19 step 6, continued).

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/clients.js` | NEW: 115 lines — Clients CRUD verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 8604 → 8502 lines. Lines 4265–4369 (105 lines) replaced by 3-line reference comment |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/shared/clients.js?v=20260801">` after natures.js |
| `tests/stage4g-test.js` | NEW: 49 tests — globals, renderClients, openClientModal, closeClientModal, saveClient (create+update), deleteClient (confirmed+cancelled), showClientDetail, LOGGER guard, regression chain |

### Extracted Globals (now in shared/clients.js, removed from app.js)

`currentClientDetailId` (changed `let`→`var` for vm testability), `renderClients`, `showClientDetail`, `openClientModal`, `closeClientModal`, `saveClient`, `deleteClient`

### Deferred CRUD Blocks

- **Collaborateurs CRUD** (lines ~4269–now, ~98 lines): `currentCollabDetailId`, `renderCollaborateurs`, `showCollabDetail`, `openCollabModal`, `closeCollabModal`, `saveCollab`, `deleteCollab`
- **Fournisseurs CRUD**: `renderFournisseurs`, `saveFournisseur`, `deleteFournisseur`
- All other CRUD (invoices, devis, RDVs, OMs, representations, accounting, etc.)

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4G)

`js/app.js` → `js/shared/calendar.js` → `js/shared/dashboard.js` → `js/shared/natures.js` → **`js/shared/clients.js`** → `js/taches.js`

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|

## Stage 4H — Collaborateurs CRUD Extraction

**Objective:** Extract Collaborateurs CRUD from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/collaborateurs.js` (AGENTS.md §19 step 6, continued).

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/collaborateurs.js` | NEW: 101 lines — Collaborateurs CRUD verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 8502 → 8407 lines. Lines 4269–4366 (98 lines) replaced by 3-line reference comment |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/shared/collaborateurs.js?v=20260801">` after clients.js |
| `tests/stage4h-test.js` | NEW: 51 tests — globals, renderCollaborateurs, openCollabModal, closeCollabModal, saveCollab (create+update), deleteCollab (confirmed+cancelled), showCollabDetail (unknown/no-oms/with-oms), regression chain |

### Extracted Globals (now in shared/collaborateurs.js, removed from app.js)

`currentCollabDetailId` (changed `let`→`var` for vm testability), `renderCollaborateurs`, `showCollabDetail`, `openCollabModal`, `closeCollabModal`, `saveCollab`, `deleteCollab`

### Dependencies

collaborateurs.js resolved at call time: `STORE.collabs/saveCollabs/oms` (storage via app.js); `esc`, `formatDate` (utils.js); `showView` (router.js); `previewOM`, `editOM` (app.js — onclick attributes).
No LOGGER calls in this module.

## Stage 4F — Natures CRUD Extraction

**Objective:** Extract Natures de prestation CRUD from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/natures.js` as the first coherent CRUD unit (AGENTS.md §19 step 6).

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/natures.js` | NEW: 75 lines — Natures CRUD verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 8668 → 8604 lines. Lines 4470–4535 (66 lines) replaced by 2-line reference comment |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/shared/natures.js?v=20260801">` after dashboard.js |
| `tests/stage4f-test.js` | NEW: 37 tests — globals, renderNatures, openNatureModal, closeNatureModal, saveNature (create+update), deleteNature (confirmed+cancelled), showNatureDetail, regression chain |
| `js/plugins/production.runtime.js` | Comment updated to reference natures.js |

### Extracted Globals (now in shared/natures.js, removed from app.js)

`renderNatures`, `showNatureDetail`, `openNatureModal`, `closeNatureModal`, `saveNature`, `deleteNature`

### Deferred CRUD Blocks

The following remain in app.js for subsequent stages:
- **Clients CRUD** (lines ~4265–4370): `renderClients`, `showClientDetail`, `openClientModal`, `closeClientModal`, `saveClient`, `deleteClient`, `currentClientDetailId`
- **Collaborateurs CRUD** (lines ~4371–4468): `renderCollaborateurs`, `showCollabDetail`, `openCollabModal`, `closeCollabModal`, `saveCollab`, `deleteCollab`, `currentCollabDetailId`
- **Fournisseurs CRUD** (lines ~4537+): `renderFournisseurs`, `saveFournisseur`, `deleteFournisseur`
- All other CRUD (invoices, devis, RDVs, OMs, representations, accounting, etc.)

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4F)

`js/core/storage.js` → ... → `js/app.js` → `js/shared/calendar.js` → `js/shared/dashboard.js` → **`js/shared/natures.js`** → `js/taches.js`

### Dependencies

natures.js resolved at call time: `STORE.natures/saveNatures/representations/invoices` (storage.js); `esc`, `money`, `formatDate` (utils.js); `showView` (router.js).

## Next Stage: Stage 4G

Stage 4F is complete. Continue extracting CRUD per AGENTS.md §19 step 6.

Recommended next: **Clients CRUD** (lines ~4265–4370, ~106 lines) or **Collaborateurs CRUD** (lines ~4371–4468, ~98 lines) into `js/shared/clients.js` / `js/shared/collaborateurs.js`.

**Preflight required before starting Stage 4G:**
1. `git fetch origin && git rev-parse HEAD origin/main` — confirm equal and both = `c39d2bc56355d06da9b92fd1166acae36294f5f2`
2. `git status --short` — confirm clean
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AI_HANDOVER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`

## Stage 4E — Dashboard Rendering Extraction

**Objective:** Extract dashboard rendering from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/dashboard.js` as an atomic unit.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/dashboard.js` | NEW: 282 lines — dashboard rendering verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 8940 → 8668 lines. Lines 201–474 (updateDashboardStats + updateDashboardOperational, 274 lines) replaced by 2-line reference comment |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/shared/dashboard.js?v=20260801">` inserted after calendar.js |
| `tests/stage4e-test.js` | NEW: 31 tests covering all extracted globals, empty/populated data paths, recovery bar, upcoming RDVs, operational alerts, chain regression |
| `js/plugins/dashboard.runtime.js` | Comment updated: "What stays in app.js" → "What lives in js/shared/dashboard.js" |

### Extracted Globals (now in shared/dashboard.js, removed from app.js)

`updateDashboardStats`, `updateDashboardOperational`

`loadDashboardInscriptionsCount` was NOT extracted — it shares `_uclNum` with `loadInscriptions` (both remain in app.js).

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4E)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` → `js/core/router.js` → ... → `js/app.js` → `js/shared/calendar.js` → **`js/shared/dashboard.js`** → `js/taches.js`

### Dependencies

dashboard.js render callbacks resolved at call time: `STORE.*` (storage.js); `normalizeRdv`, `todayStr`, `fmtMoney`, `escapeHtml`, `formatDate`, `getInvoiceTotal`, `num` (utils.js); `editInvoice`, `rdvEdit`, `loadDashboardInscriptionsCount` (app.js).

## Next Stage: Stage 4F

Stage 4E is complete. The next extraction stage should continue reducing `js/app.js` per AGENTS.md §19.

AGENTS.md §19 step 6: **Extract CRUD plugins.**

**Preflight required before starting Stage 4F:**
1. `git fetch origin && git rev-parse HEAD origin/main` — confirm equal and both = `13655db0ba579eae88b32a964f42cc01c1143b07`
2. `git status --short` — confirm clean
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AI_HANDOVER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`

## Stage 4D — Calendar Rendering Extraction

**Objective:** Extract calendar rendering from `js/app.js` into `js/shared/calendar.js` as an atomic unit.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/shared/calendar.js` | NEW: 251 lines — calendar rendering verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 9179 → 8940 lines. Two blocks removed: `calFilterMode` (line 1823) and CALENDRIER section (lines 7826–8065, 240 lines), replaced by reference comments |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/shared/calendar.js?v=20260801">` inserted after app.js, before taches.js |
| `tests/stage4d-test.js` | NEW: 32 tests covering all extracted globals, filter state, date helpers, renderCalendrier, _calRenderItem, openRdvModal, regression |
| `js/plugins/calendar.runtime.js` | Comment updated: "What stays in app.js" → "What lives in js/shared/calendar.js" |

### Extracted Globals (now in shared/calendar.js, removed from app.js)

`calFilterMode`, `openRdvModal`, `setCalFilter`, `_calDateLabel`, `_calDateSeparator`, `renderCalendrier`, `_calRenderItem`

`calFilterMode` was changed from `let` to `var` for global accessibility (consistent with module pattern).

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4D)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` → `js/core/router.js` → ... → `js/app.js` → **`js/shared/calendar.js`** → `js/taches.js`

Note: calendar.js loads AFTER app.js to preserve existing behavior (the `tasks.runtime.js` patch of `renderCalendrier` currently cannot apply at plugin load time — this is a pre-existing state, not introduced by Stage 4D).

### Dependencies

calendar.js render callbacks remain in `utils.js` (`normalizeRdv`, `todayStr`, `isRdvPaid`, etc.), `rappels.js` (`getRappels`, `getNextRappelDate`, etc.), and `app.js` (`rdvOpenForm`, `rdvEdit`, `rdvDelete`) — resolved at call time.

## Stage 4C — Routing Extraction

**Objective:** Extract routing/navigation from `js/app.js` into `js/core/router.js` as an atomic unit.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/core/router.js` | NEW: 93 lines — routing verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 9269 → 9179 lines. Two routing blocks (lines 476–514 and 2426–2480, 90 lines total) replaced by 2-line reference comments each |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/core/router.js?v=20260801">` inserted after sync.js |
| `tests/stage4c-test.js` | NEW: 32 tests covering all extracted globals, navigateTo, showPage, showView, updateSidebarStats, regression |

### Extracted Globals (now in router.js, removed from app.js)

`currentPage`, `navigateTo`, `showPage`, `showView`, `updateSidebarStats`

`currentPage` was changed from `let` to `var` to become a true global (consistent with storage.js/sync.js module pattern).

The two runtime `showView` overrides at app.js lines 7826–7869 (mobile sidebar close, logs view) remain in app.js — they patch `window.showView` at execution time.

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4C)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` → `js/core/router.js` → `js/app.js` → `js/plugins/*.runtime.js`

### Dependencies

router.js render callbacks (`updateDashboardStats`, `renderList`, `renderClients`, etc.) remain in app.js — resolved at call time (runtime), not at load time.

`navigateTo` called from app.js at: lines 592, 1479, 1503, 1837 — unchanged (global).
`showView` called 50+ times in app.js and HTML `onclick` attributes — unchanged (global).
`Shell.navigation.go()` in shell.js delegates to `showView` — unchanged.

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|

## Stage 4B — Sync Engine Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the sync engine from `js/app.js` into `js/core/sync.js` as an atomic unit.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/core/sync.js` | NEW: 210 lines — sync engine verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 9476 → 9269 lines. Sync engine block (lines 57–267, 211 lines) replaced by 3-line reference comment; stale comment updated to reference sync.js |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/core/sync.js?v=20260801">` inserted after storage.js |
| `tests/stage4b-test.js` | NEW: 52 tests covering all extracted globals, merge/tombstone behavior, syncFromServer steps, indicator, regression |

### Extracted Globals (now in sync.js, removed from app.js)

`_mergeCollections`, `_tombKey`, `_getDeletedIds`, `_markDeleted`, `_filterTombstoned`, `_syncIndicatorTimer`, `_showSyncIndicator`, `syncFromServer`

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4B)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` → `js/app.js` → `js/plugins/*.runtime.js`

### Dependencies

sync.js depends on storage.js for: `_storeGet`, `_safeSet`, `_storeSave`, `_metaUpdate`, `_pushCollection`, `_pendingKeys`, `_localMeta`, `_memCache`

`_markDeleted` is still called from app.js (lines 1604, 3036, 3039, 3115, 3229, 3258) — correct, it remains a global.

`syncFromServer` called from: `app.js` (3 sites), `auth.js` (guarded), `storage.js` `_pullFromServerNow` (guarded), `taches.js` (guarded).

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |

## Stage 4A — Pending Write Pipeline Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the pending write pipeline from `js/app.js` into `js/core/storage.js` as an atomic unit, making it available before the sync engine is loaded.

### Changed Files

|------|--------|
| `js/core/storage.js` | Extended: 53 → 266 lines. Appended pending write pipeline verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 9693 → 9475 lines. Pipeline block (indices 51–273, 223 lines) replaced by 5-line reference comment |

`_localMeta`, `_metaUpdate`, `_pendingKeys`, `_pendingAdd`, `_pendingRemove`, `_pendingClear`, `_buildPendingBulk`, `_flushPending`, `_flushPendingBeacon`, `_pullFromServerNow`, `_lastPullTs`, `_autoBackupTimer`, `_triggerAutoBackup`, `_pushCollection`, `_storeSave`

Plus event listeners: `visibilitychange`, `pagehide`, `focus`, `online`, `setInterval(30000)`.

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tests/stage4a-test.js` | 69 | ✓ 69/69 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | 77 | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full suite (baseline 1405 + 69 new) | 1474 | Not rerun (AGENTS.md §22) |

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4A)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` (Stage 4B, not yet extracted) → `js/app.js` → `js/plugins/*.runtime.js`

### Known Issues

- `tests/core-test.js` fails with `ReferenceError: _memCache is not defined` — pre-existing bug, unrelated to Stage 4A. Not fixed.
- `/tmp/mythos-4a` on VPS may contain stale Stage 4A work (pre-AGENTS.md violation). Should be cleaned up when VPS SSH access is restored.

## Next Stage: Stage 4E

Stage 4D is complete. The next extraction stage should continue reducing `js/app.js` per AGENTS.md §19.

AGENTS.md §19 step 5: **Extract Dashboard behavior.**

Candidates per ROADMAP.md: `shared/dashboard.js` (app.js lines ~700–975 — NOTE: line numbers are stale; find actual dashboard block by searching for `// ── DASHBOARD` or `function updateDashboardStats` in current app.js).

**Preflight required before starting Stage 4E:**
1. `git fetch origin && git rev-parse HEAD origin/main` — confirm equal and both = `7adb1fe5e1b6ace9ffa24f19e91827d3a34a4c2b`
2. `git status --short` — confirm clean
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AI_HANDOVER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`
4. Map callers of the target functions before extracting

## What Was Committed Before Stage 4A

### Stages 3D–3H (committed, not documented here)
Baseline entering Stage 4A: **1405 tests**. Stages 3D–3H added runtime plugins for planning, calendar, search, and other modules. See git log for exact commits.

### Stage 3C (27d9a56) — Notes Runtime
`notes.plugin.js` → `notes.runtime.js`. 74 tests.

### Stage 3B (0b5ab5f) — Contacts Runtime
`contacts.plugin.js` → `contacts.runtime.js`. 78 tests.

---

## Risks

1. **core-test.js pre-existing failure** — `_memCache is not defined`. Do not regress further; investigate when addressing storage.js primitives.
2. **STORE v2 read bypass (app.js)** — reads still use raw localStorage in some places.
3. **Duplicate function stubs (app.js ~1078–1988)** — do not remove without `onclick` audit.
4. **Production safety** — `/var/www/uthinachess/0726/Prod/` must never be modified.

---

## Production Safety (permanent)

- Do NOT commit `google_config.php` — real Google OAuth credentials
- Do NOT commit `ACCES.txt` — plaintext access code
- Do NOT commit `appdata/` or `documents/` — live client data
- Do NOT touch production at `/var/www/uthinachess/0726/Prod/`
- Do NOT restart nginx or PHP
- Do NOT deploy anything

## Legacy: Stage 3C Handover (superseded)

**Last updated:** 2026-07-31 10:00 UTC
**HEAD at that time:** 27d9a56 feat(notes): migrate to runtime plugin (Stage 3C)
**Tests at that time:** 893 (stale — actual baseline at Stage 4A start was 1405)

---

## What's Committed

### Stage 3B (0b5ab5f) — Contacts Runtime
`contacts.plugin.js` → `contacts.runtime.js`. 78 tests.

### Stage 3C (27d9a56) — Notes Runtime
`notes.plugin.js` → `notes.runtime.js`. 74 tests.

## Stage 3C — Implementation Summary

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/plugins/notes.runtime.js` | NEW — 156 lines |
| `js/plugins/notes.plugin.js` | DELETED |
| `index.html` | 1 line: plugin ref swapped |
| `tests/stage3c-test.js` | NEW — 74 tests |
| `tests/stage1c-part1-test.js` | 1 line: ref swapped |
| `tests/stage2d-test.js` | 1 line: ref swapped |
| `tests/stage3a-test.js` | 1 line: ref swapped |

Key details:
- Notes module reads `_rdGetDocs(cat)` from `redaction.js` — no STORE functions exist for notes
- Searches both 'das' and 'autres' categories by document `name` field
- Result shape: `{ id, title, subtitle, type, route, data }`
- `onBoot` validates `mp_rddocs_das` and `mp_rddocs_autres`
- `onReady` registers MythosSearch provider (id: 'notes', order: 6)

## Priority Actions for Next Session

### 1. Stage 3D — Planning Runtime

Scope:
1. Read `js/plugins/planning.plugin.js`
2. Search for `mp_rappels`, `mp_rappel_types` in `js/app.js` / `js/rappels.js`
3. Create `js/plugins/planning.runtime.js`
4. `onBoot`: validate `mp_rappels` / `mp_rappel_types`
5. `onReady`: register MythosCalendar + MythosSearch providers
6. Update `index.html`, update affected test files
7. Delete `planning.plugin.js`
8. Create `tests/stage3d-test.js` (≥50 tests)
9. All suites pass, 0 failures

### 2. Optionally commit Groups 2–4 (environment, AI tooling, docs)

---

## Risks

1. **AGENTS.md test count (939)** — stale; correct to 893.
2. **STORE v2 read bypass (app.js ~2341)** — reads still use raw localStorage.
3. **Duplicate function stubs (app.js ~1078–1988)** — do not remove without `onclick` audit.
4. **Production safety** — `/var/www/uthinachess/0726/Prod/` must never be modified.
5. **Local is 3 commits ahead of origin/main** — never push without explicit approval.

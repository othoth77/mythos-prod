## Repository State (verified 2026-08-01)

```
Branch:   main
HEAD:     <see Stage 4B commit below>
```

**Stage 4B is committed.** Sync engine extracted from `js/app.js` into `js/core/sync.js`. All Stage 4B tests pass. Regression suite passes (77/77). Total passing: 1526.

> Note: `docs/AI_HANDOVER.md` was stale — last edited for Stage 3C (893 tests). Stages 3D–3H were committed between then and Stage 4A without updating this file. The correct baseline entering Stage 4A was 1405 tests (not 893).

## Stage 4B — Sync Engine Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the sync engine from `js/app.js` into `js/core/sync.js` as an atomic unit.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/core/sync.js` | NEW: 210 lines — sync engine verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 9476 → 9269 lines. Sync engine block (lines 57–267, 211 lines) replaced by 3-line reference comment; stale comment updated to reference sync.js |
| `index.html` | 1 line: `<script src="js/core/sync.js?v=20260801">` inserted after storage.js |
| `tests/stage4b-test.js` | NEW: 52 tests covering all extracted globals, merge/tombstone behavior, syncFromServer steps, indicator, regression |

### Extracted Globals (now in sync.js, removed from app.js)

`_mergeCollections`, `_tombKey`, `_getDeletedIds`, `_markDeleted`, `_filterTombstoned`, `_syncIndicatorTimer`, `_showSyncIndicator`, `syncFromServer`

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4B)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` → `js/app.js` → `js/plugins/*.runtime.js`

### Dependencies

sync.js depends on storage.js for: `_storeGet`, `_safeSet`, `_storeSave`, `_metaUpdate`, `_pushCollection`, `_pendingKeys`, `_localMeta`, `_memCache`

`_markDeleted` is still called from app.js (lines 1604, 3036, 3039, 3115, 3229, 3258) — correct, it remains a global.

`syncFromServer` called from: `app.js` (3 sites), `auth.js` (guarded), `storage.js` `_pullFromServerNow` (guarded), `taches.js` (guarded).

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tests/stage4b-test.js` | 52 | ✓ 52/52 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | 77 | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full suite (baseline 1474 + 52 new) | 1526 | Not rerun (AGENTS.md §8) |

### Commit

```
a77f3766a8c8a07991579a8715040be7ea3decf6
refactor(sync): extract sync engine into js/core/sync.js
```

Parent: `1fb71392579754f521fb5187ecfbecd5b3c31a9b` (docs(handover): record Stage 4A commit hash and remote HEAD)

### Known Issues

Same as Stage 4A: `tests/core-test.js` pre-existing `_memCache` failure. Not fixed, not regressed.

---

## Stage 4A — Pending Write Pipeline Extraction

**Objective:** Extract the pending write pipeline from `js/app.js` into `js/core/storage.js` as an atomic unit, making it available before the sync engine is loaded.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/core/storage.js` | Extended: 53 → 266 lines. Appended pending write pipeline verbatim from app.js |
| `js/app.js` | Trimmed: 9693 → 9475 lines. Pipeline block (indices 51–273, 223 lines) replaced by 5-line reference comment |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | Updated: dynamic STORE line-finding (was hardcoded), new sandbox globals, IIFE spy reinstall after storage.js load |
| `tests/stage4a-test.js` | NEW: 69 tests covering all extracted globals, Set behaviour, _storeSave pipeline, chunking, event listeners, debounce, regression |

### Extracted Globals (now in storage.js, removed from app.js)

`_localMeta`, `_metaUpdate`, `_pendingKeys`, `_pendingAdd`, `_pendingRemove`, `_pendingClear`, `_buildPendingBulk`, `_flushPending`, `_flushPendingBeacon`, `_pullFromServerNow`, `_lastPullTs`, `_autoBackupTimer`, `_triggerAutoBackup`, `_pushCollection`, `_storeSave`

Plus event listeners: `visibilitychange`, `pagehide`, `focus`, `online`, `setInterval(30000)`.

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tests/stage4a-test.js` | 69 | ✓ 69/69 |
| `tests/stage1a-sync-bypass-regression-test.js` | 77 | ✓ 77/77 |
| Full suite (baseline 1405 + 69 new) | 1474 | Not rerun (AGENTS.md §22) |

### Script Load Order (after Stage 4A)

`js/core/storage.js` → `js/core/sync.js` (Stage 4B, not yet extracted) → `js/app.js` → `js/plugins/*.runtime.js`

### Known Issues

- `tests/core-test.js` fails with `ReferenceError: _memCache is not defined` — pre-existing bug, unrelated to Stage 4A. Not fixed.
- `/tmp/mythos-4a` on VPS may contain stale Stage 4A work (pre-AGENTS.md violation). Should be cleaned up when VPS SSH access is restored.

## Next Stage: Stage 4C

Stage 4B is complete. The next extraction stage should continue reducing `js/app.js`.

Candidates (read ROADMAP.md and remaining app.js structure):
- Stage 4C: Extract routing / navigation logic into `js/core/router.js` or similar
- Or: continue with shared module extraction per the post-Stage 4 roadmap

**Preflight required before starting Stage 4C:**
1. `git fetch origin && git rev-parse HEAD origin/main` — confirm equal
2. `git status --short` — confirm clean
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AI_HANDOVER.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`
4. Map callers of the target functions before extracting

---

## What Was Committed Before Stage 4A

### Stages 3D–3H (committed, not documented here)
Baseline entering Stage 4A: **1405 tests**. Stages 3D–3H added runtime plugins for planning, calendar, search, and other modules. See git log for exact commits.

### Stage 3C (27d9a56) — Notes Runtime
`notes.plugin.js` → `notes.runtime.js`. 74 tests.

### Stage 3B (0b5ab5f) — Contacts Runtime
`contacts.plugin.js` → `contacts.runtime.js`. 78 tests.

## Risks

1. **core-test.js pre-existing failure** — `_memCache is not defined`. Do not regress further; investigate when addressing storage.js primitives.
2. **STORE v2 read bypass (app.js)** — reads still use raw localStorage in some places.
3. **Duplicate function stubs (app.js ~1078–1988)** — do not remove without `onclick` audit.
4. **Production safety** — `/var/www/uthinachess/0726/Prod/` must never be modified.

---

## Production Safety (permanent)

- Do NOT commit `google_config.php` — real Google OAuth credentials
- Do NOT commit `ACCES.txt` — plaintext access code
- Do NOT commit `appdata/` or `documents/` — live client data
- Do NOT touch production at `/var/www/uthinachess/0726/Prod/`
- Do NOT restart nginx or PHP
- Do NOT deploy anything

## Legacy: Stage 3C Handover (superseded)

**Last updated:** 2026-07-31 10:00 UTC
**HEAD at that time:** 27d9a56 feat(notes): migrate to runtime plugin (Stage 3C)
**Tests at that time:** 893 (stale — actual baseline at Stage 4A start was 1405)

---

## What's Committed

### Stage 3B (0b5ab5f) — Contacts Runtime
`contacts.plugin.js` → `contacts.runtime.js`. 78 tests.

### Stage 3C (27d9a56) — Notes Runtime
`notes.plugin.js` → `notes.runtime.js`. 74 tests.

## Stage 3C — Implementation Summary

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `js/plugins/notes.runtime.js` | NEW — 156 lines |
| `js/plugins/notes.plugin.js` | DELETED |
| `index.html` | 1 line: plugin ref swapped |
| `tests/stage3c-test.js` | NEW — 74 tests |
| `tests/stage1c-part1-test.js` | 1 line: ref swapped |
| `tests/stage2d-test.js` | 1 line: ref swapped |
| `tests/stage3a-test.js` | 1 line: ref swapped |

Key details:
- Notes module reads `_rdGetDocs(cat)` from `redaction.js` — no STORE functions exist for notes
- Searches both 'das' and 'autres' categories by document `name` field
- Result shape: `{ id, title, subtitle, type, route, data }`
- `onBoot` validates `mp_rddocs_das` and `mp_rddocs_autres`
- `onReady` registers MythosSearch provider (id: 'notes', order: 6)

## Priority Actions for Next Session

### 1. Stage 3D — Planning Runtime

Scope:
1. Read `js/plugins/planning.plugin.js`
2. Search for `mp_rappels`, `mp_rappel_types` in `js/app.js` / `js/rappels.js`
3. Create `js/plugins/planning.runtime.js`
4. `onBoot`: validate `mp_rappels` / `mp_rappel_types`
5. `onReady`: register MythosCalendar + MythosSearch providers
6. Update `index.html`, update affected test files
7. Delete `planning.plugin.js`
8. Create `tests/stage3d-test.js` (≥50 tests)
9. All suites pass, 0 failures

### 2. Optionally commit Groups 2–4 (environment, AI tooling, docs)

---

## Risks

1. **AGENTS.md test count (939)** — stale; correct to 893.
2. **STORE v2 read bypass (app.js ~2341)** — reads still use raw localStorage.
3. **Duplicate function stubs (app.js ~1078–1988)** — do not remove without `onclick` audit.
4. **Production safety** — `/var/www/uthinachess/0726/Prod/` must never be modified.
5. **Local is 3 commits ahead of origin/main** — never push without explicit approval.
